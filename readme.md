## details

 - regular hypernetwork
 - mHC from deepseek

## performance and ablations

## possible uses

 - maybe this helps improve information to MTP heads?
 - possibly sparisfy attn farther because you can pass signals between layers cleaner and more directly now?
 - possibly improve the SWA/global mechanic, by account for SWAs weaknesses and letting the global layer dominate the hypernetwork streams?
